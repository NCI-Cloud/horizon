When we don't need to override any settings for a dashboard we then symlink
to the base file instead.  This is necessary in order to maintain the
relative display order of the dashboards in the navigation menu.  The plugin
settings modules are sorted according to the namespace and then the name
of the module itself.  So any dashboard defined in this directory would be
displayed after the default ones.
